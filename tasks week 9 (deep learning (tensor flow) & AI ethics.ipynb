    "a) Amazon wanted to automate its hiring process to expedite the selection of candidates for the thousands of job openings they have. Everything ended up being a public relations disaster since the system turned out to be sexist, favoring white guys. The training data used to create the model was most likely imbalanced, resulting in candidate selection bias. This is also another example of AI Failures.<br><br>\n",

    "b) Make sure no one is wearing a mask with your face if you have an iPhone X with a Face ID. Face ID, according to Apple, creates a 3-dimensional model of your face using the iPhone X’s powerful front-facing camera and machine learning. The machine learning/AI component allowed the system to adjust to aesthetic changes (such as putting on make-up, donning a pair of glasses, or wrapping a scarf around your neck) while maintaining security. Bkav, a security business located in Vietnam, discovered that by attaching 2D “eyes” to a 3D mask, they could successfully unlock a Face ID-equipped iPhone. The stone powder mask, which cost approximately US$200, was created. The eyeballs were simply infrared pictures printed on paper. Wired, on the other hand, attempted to defeat Face ID using masks but was unable to replicate the results.<br><br>\n",
